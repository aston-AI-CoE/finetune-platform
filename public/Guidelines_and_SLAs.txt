AI Accuracy Performance Standards and Intent Classification Guidelines [ENG]
Article 1. Purpose
This clause defines the minimum performance standards for AI response quality. It aims to ensure that vendor-provided AI models accurately understand Coupang’s customer service standards and conversational context, effectively detecting key intents, requests, and keywords to enhance service quality.
Article 2. Evaluation Items and Performance Standards
 1) Key Intent Detection & Classification Accuracy
- Definition: The proportion of customer utterances where the intent is accurately detected and classified according to Coupang’s standards. ※Reference 1_Intent Classification Table
- SLA: 95% or higher
- Evaluation Method: Monthly sampling evaluation (≥500 cases), comparison based on Coupang’s intent definitions and answer set, accuracy includes false positives/negatives
- Formula: (Number of correctly detected intents / Total evaluated utterances) × 100
 1) Request Detection & Classification Accuracy
- Definition: The proportion of customer requests accurately detected and classified according to Coupang’s 8 request types. ※Reference 2_Request Classification Table
- SLA: 90% or higher
- Evaluation Method: Includes complex utterances, accuracy measured based on priority and utterance timing
- Formula: (Number of correctly detected and classified requests / Total evaluated utterances) × 100
 1) Keyword Detection Accuracy
- Definition: The proportion of core words (Intent_tag or Critical Keyword) accurately identified from customer utterances. ※Reference 3_Keyword Classification Table
- SLA: 95% or higher
- Evaluation Method: Evaluation based on inclusion of key keywords such as product info, damage type, request, critical situations; based on Coupang’s Critical Keyword list; accuracy includes omissions/false detections
- Formula: (Number of correctly detected keywords / Total evaluated utterances) × 100
 1) Irrelevant Utterance Filtering Accuracy
- Definition: The proportion of utterances irrelevant to intent accurately identified and excluded from response targets (e.g., simple requests, feedback, reactions to agent questions, non-sentential utterances, repeated intents, customer/product info). ※Reference 4_Irrelevant Utterance Examples
- SLA: 90% or higher
- Evaluation Method: Target utterance types: 1) Simple request (no intent), 2) Simple feedback, 3) Reaction to agent utterance, 4) Non-sentential utterance, 5) Repeated/duplicate intent, 6) Customer/product info; accuracy measured based on Coupang’s irrelevant utterance definitions
- Formula: (Number of correctly filtered irrelevant utterances / Total irrelevant utterance evaluations) × 100
1. Intent Classification Guidelines
2) Intent classification must not rely solely on keyword matching. It should consider the full context and the hierarchical structure of intents (depth1~4).
Failure Case 1: Product Issue vs. Freshness Dissatisfaction
- Customer utterance: “The orange arrived bruised.”
- Correct intent: Product Issue > Product Defect > Physical Defect
- AI response: Product Dissatisfaction > Not as Expected > Freshness Dissatisfaction
- Failure reason: The customer clearly mentions a physical defect, which is Coupang’s responsibility. The AI classified it as dissatisfaction due to unmet expectations, which is the customer’s responsibility. Physical defects must be classified as Product Issue.
1) When multiple intents are detected, AI must identify the key intent based on priority (P1 > P2).
Failure Case 2: Multi-Intent Priority Error
- Customer utterance: “It arrived all broken and I want a refund…”
- Correct intent: Product Damage or Physical/Functional Defect
- AI response: Disposal Method
- Failure reason: The core utterance is about damage and refund. The AI focused on a secondary topic. When multiple intents are detected, the key intent must be prioritized. In this case, Product Damage is P1, Disposal Method is P2.
1) Intent and request must be distinguished. Intent should reflect the root cause of the customer’s request.
Failure Case 3: Product Not as Expected + Exchange Request
- Customer utterance: “It’s not what I expected so I tried to exchange it but it says the period has expired.”
- Correct intent: Product Dissatisfaction > Not as Expected > Size Dissatisfaction (P1)
- AI response: Other, Exchange > Seller Exchange Intent > Seller Exchange Refusal (P2)
- Failure reason: The customer wants an exchange due to dissatisfaction. The AI focused on the exchange method. The intent must reflect the root cause of the request.
